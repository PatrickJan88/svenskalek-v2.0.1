SvenskaLek v2.0 — AI-Collaborated Swedish Learning Web App

SvenskaLek is my first AI-collaborated personal project focused on building an interactive and accessible web application for Swedish language learners. It’s designed to be both visually engaging and functionally supportive for daily vocabulary and grammar practice.

What’s New in Version 2.0.1
✅ Fixed several bugs and minor code issues
✅  Activated sound playback for each mock vocabulary item
✅ Added 200+ mock Swedish vocabulary entries
✅ Improved visual layout of the vocabulary flashcards
✅ Enhanced project hierarchy and structure

About the Project
This web app is an AI-assisted prototype designed to support vocabulary learning for Swedish language learners. While much of the code was generated using AI tools, I led the project through the entire UX and development workflow:

My Role & Contributions
	•	User Research: Empathized with both novice and advanced language learners
	•	UX Thinking: Defined the product strategy and user journey
	•	Product Design: Designed the overall information architecture and feature set
	•	UX Flow & Prototyping: Created clear flows and interaction designs before coding
	•	AI Collaboration: Directed AI to generate initial HTML/CSS/JS code based on design
	•	Code Supervision: Reviewed and corrected AI-generated output manually
	•	Iteration: Collected feedback and made improvements accordingly

⚠️ This app currently uses mock data only and has no backend/API integrations. It is shared for discussion, learning, and showcasing AI-assisted design workflows — not intended as a production-ready product.
