SvenskaLek v2.0 — AI-Collaborated Swedish Learning Web App

SvenskaLek is my first AI-collaborated personal project focused on building an interactive and accessible web application for Swedish language learners. It’s designed to be both visually engaging and functionally supportive for daily vocabulary and grammar practice.

What’s New in Version 2.0:
* Light & Dark Mode toggle for a personalized learning experience.
* Cat-Themed UI Enhancements to bring charm and approachability to the interface.
* Daily Mission Improvements for consistent motivation and habit-building.
* Word Categorization — Vocabulary is now organized by thematic groups.
* Swedish Learning Podcast is now available directly on the homepage.
